Hello, I am Daniela Hiromi!

With a BSc in Physics at UFRGS, I have experience in content such as Physics, Mathematics, Programming and Statistics. 

I program in R, Python and C, and believe in the active participation of the community in Science & Technology discussions, and the way Iâ€™ve found to help create this path is to use my programming skills for social impact.

Other interests: cultural astronomy, decolonial astronomy, astronomy (cosmology and extragalactic), Latin American history, Asian American studies, decolonial and gender studies. I also enjoy learning new languages.
